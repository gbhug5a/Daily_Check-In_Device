## Daily Check-In Device

This device allows a senior who lives alone to check in one to three times
a day by pressing a button.  No phone calls made or answered.  Just press
a button.  But if not checked in, a push notification (Pushover app) is
sent to the relative or other person set up to receive such notices.  This
is not to be used for emergency medical alerts, only to confirm at least
once a day that the solitary senior is still functioning.  A detailed
description is found in the PDF file.
